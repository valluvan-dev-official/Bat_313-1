# Creating Variable Names :

# 1. Variable names can contain only alpha numeric characters and underscores.
# 2. Variable names must begin with a letter or the underscore character.
# 3. Variable names are case-sensitive (name, Name and NAME are three different variable names)
# 4. Variable names should not be a keyword in Python.
